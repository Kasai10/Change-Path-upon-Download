# Change-Path-upon-Download
This is a simple script that opens an interface whenever something is downloaded into the downloads folder. The interface will ask for a path to store the newly downloaded file and will also save all paths if you used them once!

Also it is important to run the Monitor_downloads.py script beforehand (you can use windows task scheduler for example) in order for the downloads folder to be tracked and the interface to open. Not much else to say but if you wish to input some filepaths withoud doing that by using the script normally you could paste them into paths.txt by using a new line for each of the paths. Also you must provide complete (not relative) paths for the script to work!
